# Shell Scripting Project-1

## GitHub API integration module 

We will talk to Github API to get more information about the application. Developers can make API calls to get more info about the application they are looking for.

Info that we are planning to retrieve from GitHub in this script can include:

- No. of repos
- passwords
- No. of issues
- No. of projects

  This script can also be used as an module. Module means other devops engineers can also use this script to get information. lets say a Team was trying to integrate JIRA integration with GitHub, bugzilla and a reporting dashboard.
